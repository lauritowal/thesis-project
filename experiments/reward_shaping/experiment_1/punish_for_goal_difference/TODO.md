- Instead of altitude ft to ground --> replace with rest altitude ft to runway... 
- If on path --> reward for decreasing difference to target height (decreasing rest altitude)
- Try give more weight to vertical track error maybe?   

- prepare docker for titze: https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19880/ai-in-aviation#articles
https://github.com/rtatze/JSBSim_gym_wrapper [IN PROGRESS]

- Train on elevevator instead of gamma hold [IN PROGRESS]
- Make the things you have now awesome, add some experiments with wind... and leave obstacles out... !

- Make plan for next steps

- Next: Wind
- Evaluate with wind
- Add wind into training ?
