## Now
- Train considering engines off and altitude

- Read about and try: https://dibyaghosh.com/blog/rl/gcsl.html


## Later
- Steady Wind (Geschwindigkeit und Stärke) --> change on parameter on every episode only


## Maybe
- Höhenabhängiger Wind --> dynamisches Flugmodel
- Consider Floyd Hub
4) Try absolute position of aircraft and target + velocity of aircraft, heading angles of both

- Punish for needed time, not distance
- Try positive rewards again?
- Increase simulation steps after action --> 10, 15 ? even higher?
