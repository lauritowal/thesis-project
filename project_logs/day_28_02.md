# Date: 28.02
## Current Todos
-> 90min each
1. Count of reached target seems not to work as intended  [DONE]
2. Ask in the RL group + tutor about the random seeds 
and think how to implement them in your project
3. Add policy entropy to your project


### Todo 1  [DONE]
It seems like the the episode ends before the target is reached, 
the picture shows the agent almost at the target. [DONE]

Hypothesis - Order of next try:

- Maybe it is also the < sign in the "at_target" method comparison --> replace with <= [DONE]
- Maybe the problem is the episode_done callback? use another callback? 
- Maybe the check is not done because the episode already ends?

Solution: 
The  constant GuidanceEnv.MIN_DISTANCE_TO_TARGET_KM was used in places 
where this.target_radius should have been used in the environment
