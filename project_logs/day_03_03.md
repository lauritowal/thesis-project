- Consider direction of landing field (Landeplatzrichtung vs Landeplatzpunkt)

### Todo 1 
- Consider direction of landing field (Landeplatzrichtung vs Landeplatzpunkt)

I was thinking about making use of reward shaping for the angle at the end...
But it seems it makes no sense, because we want the angle to be like that when reaching the end...
However, maybe it makes sense to specify a distance to the target,
once the aircraft entered this circle, we reward or punish te aircraft 
for not having the same angle as the runway 

I've added a adjustment distance to accomplish the above. Need to test it still.
